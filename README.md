# 🎨 ChoreoGraph — A Visual API Flow Builder

> **ChoreoGraph** is a web-based, no-code tool that lets developers visually **build, test, and choreograph complex API sequences** right in the browser.  
> Instead of manually coding API chains, you can **map them out visually** using an intuitive, node-based interface.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

**Work in Progress**

ChoreoGraph is currently under **active development**.  
The **core UI**, including the **interactive node editor** and **real-time configuration sidebar**, is fully functional.  

🛠️ **Next Feature in Development:**  
> The **API Execution Engine**, which will bring visual flows to life by executing chained API requests directly from the canvas.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧩 **Visual Canvas** — Drag, drop, and connect nodes to design your API workflows visually.
- ⚙️ **Interactive Configuration** — Click on any node to configure details like:
  - URL  
  - HTTP method  
  - Headers  
  - Request body  
  Changes reflect **in real-time**.
- 🎨 **Custom Nodes** — API requests are represented by color-coded nodes for different HTTP methods.
- 🔁 **State-Driven UI** — Built with modern **React principles**, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
